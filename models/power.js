// A model notifies its associated views and controllers when there has been a change in its state. 
// This notification allows the views to produce updated output, 
// and the controllers to change the available set of commands. 
// A passive implementation of MVC omits these notifications, because the application does not require them or the software platform does not support them. 

// model classes encapsulate your applicationâ€™s data and provide an API to access and manipulate that data.
